Hi! I am Wenjie Huang (黄文杰), a senior undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Top Student Program) at Sichuan University. My research interest lies in computational mathematics and numerical algorithms for plasma physics, with a specific interest in **AI for Science** and **AI for Math**. During my junior year summer, I attended a summer school at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I conducted research on **AI for Mathematics**.

  [Fourth-Order Compact Difference Schemes for the One-Dimensional Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation with Damping Term](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23449)

  **Wenjie Huang**, Hao Wang, Shiquan Zhang, Qinyi Zhang

  - This work proposes and analyzes a high-order numerical method for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with damping terms, achieving fourth-order accuracy in space and second-order in time.
  - We employed a compact finite difference scheme for spatial discretization and the Crank-Nicolson method for temporal discretization.
  - Rigorous proofs for consistency, stability, and convergence are provided and verified by numerical experiments.
