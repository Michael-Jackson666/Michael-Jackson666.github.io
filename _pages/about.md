  [Fourth-Order Compact Difference Schemes for the One-Dimensional Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation with Damping Term](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23449)

  **Wenjie Huang**, Hao Wang, Shiquan Zhang, Qinyi Zhang

  - This work proposes and analyzes a high-order numerical method for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with damping terms, achieving fourth-order accuracy in space and second-order in time.
  - We employed a compact finite difference scheme for spatial discretization and the Crank-Nicolson method for temporal discretization.
  - Rigorous proofs for consistency, stability, and convergence are provided and verified by numerical experiments.

### [AI4CFD: AI-Powered Solvers for Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://github.com/Michael-Jackson666/AI4CFD) [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/github/github-original.svg" alt="GitHub" width="20">](https://github.com/Michael-Jackson666/AI4CFD)

An open-source framework for solving problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) using deep learning. This project serves as my personal playground for exploring the synergy between AI and scientific computing.

- **Implemented several cutting-edge neural operator networks from scratch**, including **PINNs**, **DeepONet**, and **FNO**, using PyTorch.
- Applied these models to solve a variety of classic PDEs, such as the **Burgers', Navier-Stokes, and Poisson equations**.
- Published the entire codebase and experimental results on GitHub, complete with clear documentation and tutorials.

### High-Precision Numerical Solver for Euler-Bernoulli Equations

This project formed the core of my first-author research paper, focusing on developing a novel numerical method to solve a fourth-order PDE with applications in engineering.

- **Independently designed and implemented a novel fourth-order compact finite difference scheme** to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.
- Rigorously proved the **consistency, stability, and convergence** of the new scheme, ensuring its robustness.
- Verified through experiments that the new algorithm **improved computational accuracy by an order of magnitude** compared to standard methods under the same conditions.

*`Tech Stack`*: `Julia`, `MATLAB`, `Python (for plotting)`
